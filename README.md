# Hail, traveler.

Here you shall find the craft of my trade and the fruit of my devotion.

By day, I labor upon private works.  
By calling, I build, shape, and refine through code.

Yet in my heart rests a long-held quest:  
to forge a game worthy of tale and trial.  
Thus, within these halls, I experiment, learn, and share.
